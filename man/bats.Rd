\title{Observations from a bat detector}
\format{
A \code{data.frame} with 1,049 rows and 2 columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{RECDATETIME}: datetime of the recorded bat call sequence
\item \code{SPECDESCSCI}: scientific species name
}

It also contains an attribute named \code{monitoring} which is a \code{data.frame}
containing monitoring periods at which the bat detector was active. Each
row is a monitoring period, and it holds the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{start}: start datetime of the monitoring period
\item \code{end}: end datetime of the monitoring period
\item \code{time_on}: time of day at which the detector is activated
during the monitoring period
\item \code{time_off}: time of day at which the detector is deactivated
during the monitoring period
\item \code{longitude} and \code{latitude}: coordinates of the detector's location
\item \code{altitude}: altitude in meters above sea level of the detector.
