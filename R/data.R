#' A dataset containing detections of audio call sequences from
#' bats. It is a small subset of the data published by Lagerveld et al. (2023)

#' @docType data
#' @name bats
#' @format A `data.frame` with 1,049 rows and 2 columns:
#' 
#'   * `RECDATETIME`: datetime of the recorded bat call sequence
#'   * `SPECDESCSCI`: scientific species name
#'   
#' It also contains an attribute named `monitoring` which is a `data.frame`
#' containing monitoring periods at which the bat detector was active. Each
#' row is a monitoring period, and it holds the following columns:
#' 
#'   * `start`: start datetime of the monitoring period
#'   * `end`: end datetime of the monitoring period
#'   * `time_on`: time of day at which the detector is activated
#'      during the monitoring period
#'   * `time_off`: time of day at which the detector is deactivated
#'      during the monitoring period
#'   * `longitude` and `latitude`: coordinates of the detector's location
#'   * `altitude`: altitude in meters above sea level of the detector.
